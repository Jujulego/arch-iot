1) **Code** 

2) Maximum coverage of your wireless communication : **approximately 20 meters (with a step of 80 cm)**

3) 
- How to increase the output power of your transmitter? : rd = NETSTACK_RADIO.set_value(RADIO_PARAM_TXPOWER, 7)
- New maximum coverage of your transmitter : **approximately 30 meters (with a step of 80 cm)**

4) 
- Can you change the radio frequency channel? How? :   Yes, rd = NETSTACK_RADIO.set_value(RADIO_PARAM_CHANNEL, 20)
- What is the default channel used by the motes ? : 26
Set the new channel equal to 23. Compare the quality of transmission between the default channel and the new one : 23 is better 
Analyze your Packet Error Rate (PER) for each channel : 23: 0/10 erreurs; 26: 8/10 erreurs

5) How can you transmit in the frequency band 868 MHz ? : 
Run the example zolertia zoul /cc1200 demo and measure the new possible coverage of your zolertia
motes. What is the relation between the range and the frequency? :
